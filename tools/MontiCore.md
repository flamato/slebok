## Description

MontiCore is a full-fledged, open-source, language workbench for the design and realization of textual domain-specific languages (DSL). It enables the research of model-based software development methods employing a variety of DSLs and modeling languages. On top of this, MontiCore and its DSL products are successfully in use in academic and industrial research projects in various domains such as automotive software modeling, cloud architecture and security modeling, model-based robotics, smart energy management, neural network modeling. The design rationale of MontiCore is to provide a powerful and efficient workbench for the agile creation of DSLs along with their accompanying infrastructure such as analyses, transformations, and code generators. MontiCore features a functional and highly extensible architecture which allows to even further customize the DSL development process itself.
