## Description

The GEMOC Studio is an Eclipse package atop the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), which includes:

* _The GEMOC Language Workbench_: to be used by language designers to build and compose new executable domain-specific languages (xDSLs);
* _The GEMOC Modeling Workbench_: to be used by domain designers to create, execute and coordinate models conforming to xDSLs.

The different concerns of a xDSL, as defined with the tools of the language workbench, are automatically deployed into the modeling workbench. They parametrize a generic execution framework that provides various generic services, such as graphical animation, debugging tools, trace and event managers, timeline visualizations, concurrency analysis, concurrent execution of heterogeneous models, etc.
