## Disambiguation

"refactoring" can refer to
- a discipline (the refactoring track at a conference)
- an activity (someone is refactoring code)
- the result of such an activity (one program is a refactoring of another)
- a programming tool aiding in such an activity (in disciplined writing referred to as "refactoring tool")
- a refactoring pattern (as catalogued, e.g., in Fowler's book)
- an instance of such a pattern

## Classification

## First Mention

[Opdyke's PhD thesis](http://www.laputan.org/pub/papers/opdyke-thesis.pdf), even though [Griswold's PhD thesis](http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/wgg/Abstracts/gristhesis.ps.gz) addresses the same problem but calls it _restructuring_ instead of refactoring.
