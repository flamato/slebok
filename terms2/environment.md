# Environment

## Definition
A mapping of names to values or types. Used in [evaluation](Evaluator) and [typechecking](Typechecker) to carry name bindings. The environment is passed around (propagated) according to the scoping rules of the language, and may use a more complicated data structure to accomodate nested and/or named [scopes](Scope).
