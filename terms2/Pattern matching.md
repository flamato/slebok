# Pattern matching

## Definition
A technique for comparing (typically [algebraic](Algebraic data type)) data structures, where one or both structures may contain variables (sometimes refered to as meta-variables). Upon successful match, variables are bound to the corresponding substructure from the other side. Related to [Unification](Unification) in Prolog, but often more restricted.
