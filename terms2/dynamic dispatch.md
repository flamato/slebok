# Dynamic dispatch

## Definition
The process of selecting, at runtime, which implementation of a method to call at runtime; typically based on the the actual class of the object on which the method is called (as opposed to the static type of the variable). With *multiple dispatch*, the selection is done based on some or all arguments, making it a kind of runtime [Overload resolution](Overload resolution).
