# Chomsky normal form

## Definition
A simplified form of grammars where all the [production rules](Production rule) are of the form *A → BC* or *A → a* or *S → ε*, where *A*, *B* and *C* are [nonterminals](Nonterminal symbol) (with neither *B* nor *C* being the start symbol), *a* is a [terminal](Terminal symbol), *ε* is the empty string, and *S* is the [Start symbol](Start symbol). The third rule is only applicable if the empty string is in the language. Any [Context-free grammar](Context-free grammar) can be converted to this form, and any grammar in this form is context free.
