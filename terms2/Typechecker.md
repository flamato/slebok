# Typechecker

## Definition
A program that detects type errors, ensuring [Type safety](Type safety) in a [statically typed](Static typing) language. Often combined with other static semantic checks and processing, such as [Overload resolution](Overload resolution), [Name binding](Name binding), and checking access restrictions on names. Can be seen as a form of abstract interpretation, where the abstract values are the types, and all operations are defined according to their static semantics (i.e., type signature) rather than their dynamic semantics. C.f. [Semantic analysis](Semantic analysis).
