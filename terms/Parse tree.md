# Parse tree

## Definition
A tree that shows the structure of a string according to a grammar. The tree contains both the tokens of the original string, and a trace of the derivation steps of the parse, thus showing how the string is a valid parse according to the grammar. Typically, each leaf corresponds to a [Token](Token), each interior node corresponds to a [Production rule](Production rule), and the root node to a production rule of the [Start symbol](Start symbol).
