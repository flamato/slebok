# Static semantics

## Definition
The part of language semantics which is processed at compile time (statically). Often includes constraints that might be part of the syntax, but which is done separately in order to keep the grammar [context-free](Context-free grammar). Includes concepts like [Name binding](Name binding) and [Typechecking](Typechecking), and is used to eliminate a large class of invalid or erroneous programs. See [Static typing](Static typing).
