# Controlled Change
## Definition
> a change of a software artefact which is guaranteed to satisfy given conditions

By definition, a [refactoring](Refactoring.md) is a controlled change, since it is guaranteed to preserve well-formedness and behaviour. Other controlled changes may guarantee other properties and more generally, controlled change may apply to languages that have no notion of behaviour. 

Controlled change may be of particular interest for certified software artifacts, which need not be re-certified if all changes to it are performed by a (certified) controlled change tool.
