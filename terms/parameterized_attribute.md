# Parameterized attribute

## Definition
An attribute whose value depends on a client-supplied parameter, as well as on its semantic function.

Cannot use classic [static](static_attribute_evaluation.md) [exhaustive](exhaustive_attribute_evaluation.md) evaluation algorithms since the number of possible parameters is unbounded. Is typically evaluated using [recursive attribute evaluation](recursive_attribute_evaluation.md).
