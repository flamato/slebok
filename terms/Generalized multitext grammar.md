# Generalized multitext grammar (GMTG)

## Definition
A synchronous grammar formalism that is weakly equivalent to [Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems](Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems) (LCFRS), but retains much of the notational and intuitive simplicity of a [Context-Free Grammar](Context-Free Grammar) (CFG).
