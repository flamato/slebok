# Scope

## Definition
 A collection of identifier bindings â€“  i.e., what is captured by the [Environment](Environment) at some point in the code or in time. 
#### Nested
With nested scopes, variables in inner scopes may *shadow* those in outer scopes, and variables are removed as control flows out of the scope. Variable shadowing may be forbidden in some languages.
 
#### Named
With named scopes, we can refer to names in scopes that are not ancestors of the current scope. For example, with C++ classes and namespaces and Java packages and (static) classes.
