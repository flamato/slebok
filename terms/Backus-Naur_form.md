# Backus-Naur form (BNF)

## Definition
A formal notation for grammars, where productions are written `<symbol> ::= <symbol1> "literal" ...`. The original BNF was used to define ALGOL and had only basic features, it was later extended to support repetition (`*`, `+`), optionality (`?` or `[â€¦]`) and alternatives (`|`). Currently there is no one standardised EBNF, but rather a collection of dialects with slightly varying expressiveness.
