# Kleene closure

## Definition
A metasyntactic sugar for repetition: ```x*``` ("Kleene star") means that ```x``` can be repeated zero or more times, and ```x+``` ("Kleene cross") means that ```x``` can be repeated one or more times. The language that the Kleene star generates, is a monoid with concatenation as the binary operation and epsilon as the identity element.
