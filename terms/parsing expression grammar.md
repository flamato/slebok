# Parsing expression grammar (PEG)

## Definition
A form of [Analytic grammar](Analytic grammar), giving rules that can be directly applied to parse a string [top-down](Top-down parser). Similar to a [Context-free grammar](Context-free grammar), but the rules are unambiguously interpreted; for example, alternatives are tried in order. Related to [parse combinators](Parser combinator). PEGs are a useful and straight-forward technique for parsing software languages.
It is suspected that there are context-free languages that cannot be parsed by a PEG, but this has not been proved.
