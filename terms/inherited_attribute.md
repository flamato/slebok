# Inherited attribute

## Definition
An inherited attribute of a [nonterminal](nonterminal_symbol.md) X must be defined by each
[production rule](production_rule.md) that has X on its right-hand side. Inherited attributes are typically used for propagating information downwards in a [syntax tree](abstract_syntax_tree.md). For example, propagating the set of visible declarations of a method to the statements inside it.
