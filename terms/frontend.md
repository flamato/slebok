## Definition
The first stage of a compiler or language processor, typically including a parser (possibly with a tokeniser), and a typechecker (semantic analyser). Sometimes also includes desugaring. Is typically responsible for giving the programmer feedback on errors, and translating to the internal [AST](Abstract_syntax_tree.md) or representation used by the rest of the system.
