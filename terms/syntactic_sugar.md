# Syntactic sugar

## Definition
Syntax fragments within a software language that are designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer. A language processor usually includes a special desugaring phase where syntactic sugar is resolved in terms of basic features.
