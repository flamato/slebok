# Language

## Definition
A system of communication, with structure ([syntax](Tag Index#markdown-header-Syntax)) and meaning ([semantics](Tag Index#markdown-header-Semantics)), and [abstractions](Abstraction) that allow you to communicate usefully at different levels (i.e., more than just pointing at concrete things or showing a picture of something â€“  where the meaning would be the thing itself).
