# Synthesized attribute

## Definition
A synthesized attribute of a [nonterminal](nonterminal_symbol.md) X must be defined by each
[production rule](production_rule.md) that has X on its left-hand side. Synthesized attributes are typically used for propagating information upwards in a [syntax tree](abstract_syntax_tree.md). For example, propagating the type of an expression node to its enclosing statement.
