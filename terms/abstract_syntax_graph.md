# Abstract Syntax Graph
## Definition
> a graph representation of a program, for linear (textual) languages usually overlaid by, or overlaying, an [abstract syntax tree](abstract_syntax_tree.md)

For (textual) [grammar](grammar.md) based approaches, the abstract sytax graph is usually a temporary artefact obtained by [program analysis](program_analysis.md) (name, type, etc.), enhancing the [abstract syntax tree](abstract_syntax_tree.md); for [metamodel](metamodel.md) based approaches, it is an instance of the [metamodel](metamodel.md), and hence the primary representation of the program.

Abstract syntax graphs are a convenient starting point for many [editor services](editor_service.md); for [grammar](grammar.md) based approaches, maintaining them under [editing](editing.md) (i.e., keeping programs and their abstract syntax graph in sync) is challenging.
