# Scannerful parsing

## Definition
Parsing is divided into two parts; a [Tokeniser](Tokeniser) that deals with the lexical syntax and a parser that deals with the sentence syntax. 
#### Benefits
Faster than scannerless parsing, because the lexical syntax is specified with a regular grammar which can be parsed very efficiently.
 
#### Drawbacks
Cannot deal with arbitrary composition of languages.
