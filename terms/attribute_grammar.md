# Attribute grammar

## Definition
An extension of context-free grammars with derived properties ("attributes") of the nonterminals. The derived property values are defined using semantic functions, associated with the productions. Can be used to automatically compute static properties of abstract syntax tree nodes like name bindings, types of expressions, error messages, generated code, etc.
