# Domain-specific language (DSL)

## Definition
A language (i.e., not just a library) with abstractions targeted at a specific problem domain. 
#### Benefits
Easier programming, more efficient or secure, possibly better error reports
 
#### Drawbacks
Lots of implementation work, language fragmentation, learning/training issues, less tooling, troublesome interoperability, possibly worse error reports
 
#### External DSL

#### Internal or embedded DSL
