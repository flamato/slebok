# Static typing

## Definition
When [Type safety](Type safety) is enforced at compile type (though some tests, such as for [Typecasting](Typecasting), may be done at runtime). 
#### Benefits
Detects a large an important class of errors (type errors) at compile time; enables advanced optimisations and efficient memory use.
 
#### Drawbacks
Type system may become either overly complicated or overly restrictive; doesn't help with non-type errors; makes dynamic loading of code somewhat more complicated; type declarations may be cumbersome if the language lacks [Type inference](Type inference).
