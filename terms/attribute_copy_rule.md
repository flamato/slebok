# Copy rule

## Definition
An attribute equation that merely copies an attribute from a node to its parent, child, or sibling.

Practical attribute grammar systems typically include short-hand notations that make copy rules implicit, in order to make the attribute grammar more readable and easier to modify.

## Variations
Kastens and Waite discuss the following three short-hand mechanisms:
    * INCLUDING: A mechanism allowing a child to access an attribute of a remote parent.
    * CONSTITUENTS: A mechanism computing the union of certain attribute values throughout a subtree.
    * CHAIN: A mechanism computing a combination of certain attributes through a preorder traversal of a subtree.
