# Abstract syntax tree (AST)

## Definition
A tree representation of the syntactic structure of a sentence; similar to a [Parse tree](Parse tree), but usually ignoring literal [nonterminals](Nonterminal symbol) and nodes corresponding to [productions](Production rule) that don't directly contribute to the structure of the language (e.g., parenteses, productions used to encode [operator priority](Priority rule) and so on). May represent a slightly simpler language that the parse tree, for example, with operator calls [desugared](Desugaring) to function calls, and variations of a construct folded into one. Can be represented using as trees or terms, and described by an algebraic data type or a regular tree grammar.
