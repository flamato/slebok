# Abstraction

## Definition
Focusing on relevant details while leaving irrelevant details unspecified or hidden away. *Data abstraction* (e.g., classes and interfaces) hides the details of how a data structure is represented, instead giving an interface to manipulate the data. *Control abstraction* (e.g., functions, methods) hides *how* something is done (the algorithm), focusing instead on *what* is done.
