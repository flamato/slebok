# Scannerless parsing

## Definition
When scanning and parsing is unified into one process that deals with with the input characters directly. 
#### Benefits
Can parse combinations of languages that have different lexical syntax. Lexical syntax can be context-free, not just regular.
 
#### Drawbacks
Slower than scannerful parsing. Can lead to hard to find lexical ambiguities.
