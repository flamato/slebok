# Name binding

## Definition
A part of language processing where names are associated with their declarations, according to [scoping](Scope) and [Namespace](Namespace) rules. A name's binding is typically determined by checking the [Environment](Environment) at the use site. 
#### Static
When done statically (or *early*), name binding is often combined with [typechecking](Typechecker).
 
#### Dynamic
Names are bound at runtime; also applies to [Dynamic dispatch](Dynamic dispatch) (where it is sometimes called *late* or *virtual* binding), where certain properties (such as types) may be known statically, but the exact operation called is determined at runtime.
